    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg Minced Beef</li>
            <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>140g extra-mature or mature cheddar, grated</li>
            <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>Burger Buns</li>
            <li>Lettuce, Tomatoes & Sauces</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and eggs with 1 tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Shape the mix into 12 burgers. Chill until ready to cook for up to 24 hrs. Or freeze for up to 3 months. <em>Just stack between squares of baking parchment to stop the burgers sticking together, then wrap well. Defrost overnight in the fridge before cooking.</em></li>
            <li>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through. Meanwhile, warm as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own, served with their favourite accompaniments.</li>
          </ol>
